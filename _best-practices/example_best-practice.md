In this area follows the introduction and the explanation of a specific challenge. Furthermore, it should be described why it is important and what ways one has to overcome it. Additionally, it should be reflected to what extent those ways are suitable or what is critical about them. The goal of the best practice page is to cover practical challenges that may arise during the design process of shape-changing interfaces. You are invited to create your own best practice or to publish the results of your workshops, which aimed to train your aquired knowledge in practice.
