# Using Toolkits for Prototyping
Prototyping [Elastic Displays](/terms/elastic-display) is challenging because it involves complex electronics as well as mechanical engineering. Specific use contexts may require different actuation approaches. What are suitable tools to test complex Elastic Display applications in an early development state?

We describe prototyping toolkits on three technological layers that can lower the barrier to implementation of classic interfaces: 
1. a standard platform for hardware prototyping, dealing with some aspects of actuation
2. a cross-platform software layer for applications and
3. tools for [end-user programming](/terms/end-userprogramming)

- followed up by linked explanations on different possibilities to overcome the challenge, for example [Physical Programming](/terms/physical-programming), [4D Printing](/terms/4d-printing), [Rapid Prototyping](/terms/rapid-prototyping), electromechanical/pneumatic/hydraulic actuation, [smart materials](/terms/smart-materials)
- (optional) decision helper
