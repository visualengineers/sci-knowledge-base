# Identifying Contexts of Use
Current research in shape-changing interfaces is limited by the complexity of hardware (as described earlier) which results in many devices being fragile, hard to replicate, and not suitably robust for long term use. One consequence is that in-situ evaluations of shape-change with real tasks are rare. Such evaluations will help to assess suitable contexts of use, the fit between tasks and interfaces, and issues around the cultural appropriation of shape-change.

### HNF Paderborn


Since October 2018, the exhibition of the [HNF Paderborn](https://visualistik.de/work/ein-touchdisplay-das-nachgibt)
computer museum presents an elastic display. Visitors can use it to try out a physics simulation, steer a space ship in distress or influence a swarm of particles.
