# Designing for Temporality
Shape-changing interfaces require temporal design: there is an important challenge in translating behavioural sketches and functional descriptions of behaviour into actual designs. While sketches and prototypes of static forms provide representations that are visually and tangibly comparable by multiple people simultaneously, dynamic form has temporal aspects that are difficult to compare in parallel. This makes traditional methods such as design critique more difficult to perform. In particular, the direct interaction a user has with a shape-changing interface offers a unique experience to that person; there is not yet a language that supports the articulation of properties, experiences, or sensations, such as colour or material properties in traditional product design.
