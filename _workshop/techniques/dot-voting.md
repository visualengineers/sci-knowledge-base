Dot voting is a democratic and straightforward voting activity for recognizing preferences among limited options in a group. 

1. Participants are each given a set number of dot stickers.
2. They place dot stickers next to options presented that they like.
3. Options with the most dots win (winner-takes-all)

Dot voting has several weaknesses, such as persuaded voting, group voting or even split among the first two options that can cause false or misleading results. Adaptations and constraints to prevent these common pitfalls are:

- Digital voting, e.g. using [Mural.co](https://mural.co) or [Miro](https://miro.com/)
- Give voters time to research the alternatives
- Dictating a voting order
- Ranking/weighting each participant's dots, i.e. "SuperDots"
- Color-code votes to signify different voting criteria
