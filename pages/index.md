# About 
The Shape-changing Interfaces Knowledge Base originates from the research project [ZELASTO]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/daten-zum-anfassen/) which explores the interaction with complex data using [Zoomable User Interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/zoomable-user-interface) on [Elastic Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/elastic-display). We aim to spread recent knowledge on the research of [shape-changing interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/shape-changing-interface) (SCI) both theoretically and practically. [Terms and Concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms-and-concepts/) provide a theoretical overview of SCI terminology. Focusing especially on elastic displays, [Best Practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/best-practices/) explain how to practically overcome current challenges in SCI development. Challenges cover aspects of technology, user experience, design and society, each of the topics being important in different stages of application development. Additional modular workshop instructions for each Best Practice lower the barrier to implementation.
