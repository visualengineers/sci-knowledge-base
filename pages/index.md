# Project Background

The Shape-changing Interfaces Knowledge Base (SCI-KB) originates from the research project [ZELASTO]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/daten-zum-anfassen/) which explores the interaction with complex data using [Zoomable User Interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/zoomable-user-interface) on [Elastic Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/elastic-display). We aim to spread recent knowledge on the research of [shape-changing interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/shape-changing-interface) (SCI) both theoretically and practically.  SCI-KB’s heart is a deeply interwoven 3-level-architecture of knowledge items about shape-changing interfaces. A [Workshop Builder]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshop-builder) provides assistance in finding an arrangement of the knowledge items tailored to individual needs in order to hold a customized workshop. The core is supplemented by additional [resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/) such as paper references, links and media content and thematically structured by means of tags on the meta-level.

The knowledge modulesitems [Terms]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms-and-concepts/#terms), [Concept]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms-and-concepts/#concepts) and [Best Practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/best-practices/) can be arranged in any combination and pervade each of the three conceptual levels “Learn”, “Apply” and “Contribute”. 

**Term**. On the "Learn" level, each term explains a technical term for shape-changing interfaces, for example "Elastic Display". On the "Apply" level, examples show how the term is used in practice. The "Contribute" level invites users to modify or add terms.

**Concept**. In the style of a cheat sheet, each concept explains on the "Learn" level an application-independent principle that can be useful for the implementation of a shape-changing interface. This includes, for example, design guidelines, overviews of chart types and data types or a gesture catalogue for interaction with elastic displays. On the "Apply" level, a Concept provides workshop material. Analogous to a Term, a Concept can be modified or created at the "Contribute" level.

**Best Practice**. On the "Learn" level, a best practice explains a practical challenge that may arise in the design process of shape-changing interfaces, such as the choice of a suitable prototyping technology, and shows ways to overcome the challenge. On the "Apply" level, there are suggestions on how to train the solutions in a workshop using materials provided by the Concepts particularly. Workshop participants are invited to publish the results of their workshops on the "Contribute" level or to create their own best practice.

With the **Workshop Builder**, modular workshops tailored to the custom needs can be composed from the knowledge items. Therefore, the starting point for a practical walkthrough through SCI-KB that is based on the context of the workshop and its objectives is suggested. The walktrough may be thematic, problem- or topic-oriented, a deep-dive into specific knowledge or explorative.
