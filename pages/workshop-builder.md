# Workshop Builder
The Workshop Builder **helps you plan and prepare workshops that fit your needs**. You may use it in advance of each workshop as the preliminary questions are always the same and the tips and tools are reusable. First of all, it is important to know the context and goal of the workshop. Next, the basic procedure can be determined and the appropriate knowledge items can be arranged. 

## Customize Your Workshop
Answer the following questions to get your personal Knowledge Item suggestions you can pick from. You will find workshop material and further instructions within each chosen Knowledge Item.

    <h3>Define your aim</h3>
    Describe your goal as short and precise as possible. If you are stuck, perhaps the S.M.A.R.T. criteria or an “is not” analysis (excluding everything that is not the objective) will help.
