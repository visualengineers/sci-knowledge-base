# Workshop Builder
The Workshop Builder **helps you plan and prepare workshops that fit your needs**. You may use it in advance of each workshop as the preliminary questions are always the same and the tips and tools are reusable. First of all, it is important to know the context and goal of the workshop. Next, the basic procedure can be determined and the appropriate knowledge items can be arranged. 

## Define your aim
Describe your goal as short and precise as possible. What do you want to get out of the workshop? If you are stuck, perhaps the [S.M.A.R.T.]({{site.baseurl}}/terms/smart) criteria or an "is not" analysis (excluding everything that is not the objective) will help.

## Customize Your Workshop
Answer the following questions to explore Knowledge Items that cover your needs. Within the suggested Items, simply choose the ones you are interested in. Each Knowledge Item provides you with workshop material and further instructions on how to train its content in a workshop.
