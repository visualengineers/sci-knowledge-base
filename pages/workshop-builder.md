# Workshop Builder
The Workshop Builder **helps you plan and prepare workshops that fit your needs**. You may use it in advance of each workshop as the preliminary questions are always the same and the tools are reusable. First of all, it is important to know the context and goal of the workshop. Next, the basic procedure can be determined and the appropriate knowledge items can be arranged. 

### Define your aim
Describe your goal as short and precise as possible. What do you want to get out of the workshop? If you are stuck, try these tools: SMART, "What not",...

### Set up your workplace
What's the best place to hold your workshop? Online or offline, face-to-face or siiting in your hancock all alone?
The decision on the workplace should be made considering number and skills of participants as well as the location and time the workshops is going to take place. It involves choosing an appropriate tool to set up the place the workshop will be hold. 

teams: same/different Time/Space Matrix
single user: same/different time Matrix
