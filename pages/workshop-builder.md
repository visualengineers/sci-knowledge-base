The Workshop Builder is a tool we developed to **help you plan and prepare workshops that fit your needs**. You may use it in advance of each workshop as the preliminary questions are always the same and the tools are reusable. First of all, it is important to know the context and goal of the workshop. Next, the basic procedure can be determined and the appropriate knowledge items can be arranged.
