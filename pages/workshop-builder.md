# Workshop Builder
The Workshop Builder **helps you plan and prepare workshops that fit your needs**. You may use it in advance of each workshop as the preliminary questions are always the same and the tools are reusable. First of all, it is important to know the context and goal of the workshop. Next, the basic procedure can be determined and the appropriate knowledge items can be arranged. 

### Define your aim
Describe your goal as short and precise as possible. What do you want to get out of the workshop? If you are stuck, perhaps the [S.M.A.R.T.]({{site.baseurl}}/terms/smart) criteria or an "is not" analysis (excluding everything that is not the objective) will help.

### Set up your workplace
What's the best place to hold your workshop? Online or offline, face-to-face or siiting in your hancock all alone?
The decision on the workplace should be made considering number and skills of participants as well as the location and time the workshops is going to take place. It involves choosing an appropriate tool to set up the place the workshop will be hold.

### Stack your Knowledge Items

> If you already know, which Knowledge Items you are going to use, you can skip this and start over now.

The following questions help you to find the starting point for your practical walkthrough through SCI-KB. Within the suggested approach, choose the Knowledge Items you are interested in. Each Knowledge Items provides you with workshop material and further instructions on how to train its content in a workshop.
 
- I am / We are at a certain development stage or I am interested in a certain topic. 
  **Thematic**. Search Best Practices within [technology](technology), [user experience](ux), [design](design) or [society](society). 
- I am / We are facing a complex challenge and don't know where to start. 
  **Problem-oriented**. Search all [Best Practices](best-practices)
- I am / We are missing some theoretical background in design and implementation techniques.
  **Technology-oriented**. Search [Concepts]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/#concepts)
