Designing, prototyping and implementing shape-changing interfaces comes along with a high material consumption. Some of it already becomes waste after a short time what is best to avoid. In other words: The most sustainable material is the one that has never been used. Therefore, digitalize the design process if possible, hold online workshops, use emulators for prototyping, and reuse materials. If the use of new materials is necessary, sustainable materials that can be recycled and biodegrades should be preferred.

**Sustainable Fabrics**

As it comes to elastic displays, the fabric on the surface must have sufficient elasticity and durability to withstand all user inputs and long-term installations. An option to consider is lyocell (also: tencel), which is not only elastic and durable, but also anti-bacterial and available in various textures.

**Digital Prototyping**

Currently, we are developing an emulator for elastic displays. We hope, that it can be tested here soon.
