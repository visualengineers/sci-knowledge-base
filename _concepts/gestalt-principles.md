The Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception are a set of rules based on psychological theories of human perception. They were developed in the 1920s by German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Kohler.They stated that the human brain is wired to see structure, logic, and patterns in order to make sense of the world around us. In other words, humans want to see structure by default. The principles are widely used in modern design asthey help designers to determine which design elements are the most effective ones in order to get the user's attention, and create easy-to-use, intuitive products.
