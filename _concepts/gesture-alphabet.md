We propose a gesture alphabet to describe gestures that are used to interact with an elastic display. The alphabet contains 7 basic hand postures which can be classified into *single finger*, *multiple finger* and *hand* postures, reflecting the area touched on the display when performing an interaction. According to Kammer et al.'s classification in [Investigating Gestures on Elastic Tabletops]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references), elastic gestures also differ in the type of deformation they cause on the display (*push*, *touch* or *pull*). Furthermore, they can be static, dynamic or circular using one or both hands. In real application scenarios, several users often interact with the application simultaneously.

### Research Background

Gestures performed on an elastic display are a subset of [gestures]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/gesture) described in HCI research. For example, interaction does not contain gestures performed in mid-air or beat gestures marking the rhythm of speech. Elastic displays are instead suitable for types of gestures that can be performed by physically touching and shaping a malleable surface. In research, such gestures are most often referred to as deictic gestures (pointing), iconic gestures (follow conventions to illustrate speech such as thumbs up) and symbolic/emblematic gestures (independent of speech such as sign-language).

 The gesture alphabet is derived from 27 single- and both-handed gestures defined by Troiano et al. in [User-Defined Gestures for Elastic, Deformable Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references)) and a 10 gesture collection by Dand and Helmsley in [Obake: interactions with a 2.5D elastic display]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#links). When combining the two collections we adopted only those gestures which in our experience have proven to be useful.
