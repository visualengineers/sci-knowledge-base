title: Set of Gestures for Elastic Displays
description: set of gestures in interactive visualizations

*"A gesture is a motion of the body that contains information. Waving goodbye is a gesture. Pressing a key on a keyboard is not a gesture because the motion of a finger on its way to hitting a key is neither observed nor significant. All that matters is which key was pressed".* [Kurtenbach and Hulteen]

Gestures are the input through which users interact with the interface of an display. But where exactly does it start and where does it end? Is it just a movement or maybe more? According to the cite from Kurtenbach and Hulteen a gesture can be defined as **movement of the body that is performed to convey meaning**. Meaning therefore implicitly determines the relevant components of a single gesture and sets its boundaries.

### Types of Gestures
Numerous approaches exist to classify gestures. Semiotic gestures are the ones that have been used in HCI mostly.

**Functional classification by Cadoz**

1. Ergotic: modify environment using force
2. Epistemic : explore the environment via tactile sense
3. Semiotic : transfer information to the environment by following conventions, e.g. wave good-bye, sign language 

**Muser**

[Investigating Gestures on Elastic Tabletops]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references)

1. Deictic: pointing, e.g. using a mouse pointer
2. Motoric: marks the rhythm of speech 
3. Symbolic / emblematic: contextual conventions, e.g. thumbs up
4. Iconic: represents the content of the speech, e.g. shape of an object
5. Metaphoric: illustrates abstract ideas

**Kendon's continuum** (from left to right less dependency on speech)

Gesticulations (Beat, Cohesive) > Language-Like (Iconic) > Pantomimes (Pantomimic) > Emblems (Deictic) > Sign Language (Symbolic)

**Gesture and Sign Language in Human-Computer Interaction**

Cited in [An Intuitive Two-Handed Gestural Interface for Computer Supported Product Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references)

1. predefined symbolic commands (emblems): based on technical commands
2. gesticulations representing content of speech
3. act gestures to describe the form of objects (descriptive) or transform objects (manipulative)

**Google material design**

1. navigational gestures
2. act gestures
3. manipulative gestures

### Set of Gestures for Elastic Displays
Gestural interaction on elastic displays includes users touching and shaping an elastic surface with their hands. The user's intention to "tell" the display something meaningful creates the boundaries that define start and end of a single gesture. (Note: Under [tracking technologies]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/tracking-technologies) you can find more on technical gesture recognition, derived from the user-defined gesture set.)

Compared to traditional HCI elastic displays enlarge the space of ergotic and epistemic gestures, as users actively shape the display surface in depth and are provided with rich haptic feedback. Among semiotic gestures elastic displays make use of deictic, symbolic, emblematic and iconic gestures only as these are the ones that can be performed by physically touching and shaping a malleable surface.
