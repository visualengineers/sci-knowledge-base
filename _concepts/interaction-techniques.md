description: User tasks in interactive visualizations

User tasks describe actions users perform in interactive visualizations. Diverse appraoches have been made to somehow formalize these actions, most of them taking into account at least the abstract motivation (why) and concrete action (how) of a task. Descriptions differ for example in the level of detail, in the way they reflect the contextual embedding of the task (e.g. data, context, user) and can either be top-down or bottom-up-approaches.
