A mood board is a visual collage of assets (images, typography,...) and materials intended to communicate the style, voice, direction, basic tone or language of a particular design, brand, or project. Being an effective communication tool it can be used to convey a general idea or feeling about a particular topic in early states of creation. A mood board may be physical or digital, can be based upon a set topic or can be any material chosen at random.
