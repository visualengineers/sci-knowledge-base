A mood board is a visual collage of assets (images, typography,...) and materials intended to communicate the style, voice, direction, and language of a particular design, brand, or project. It can be based upon a set topic or can be any material chosen at random. A mood board can be used to convey a general idea or feeling about a particular topic in such ways as they define the basic tone for further design. A moodboard may be physical or digital, and can be effective presentation tools or serve as a basis for discussion by leaving freedom for inspiration and new ideas.
