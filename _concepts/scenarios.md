Each scenario is a believable story that describes specific situations that trigger use of what you are designing as well as significant acitivities and the personal experience of each persona. Scenarios can bring to life your personas by featuring them in the role of a user, usually by placing the persona in a specific context with a problem they want to or have to solve. Scenarios can be used to derive weighted requirements in product / service development process that reflect the target users' needs.
