### Gestures on Elastic Displays
Gestural interaction on elastic displays includes users **touching and shaping an elastic surface with their hands** to convey meaning. Therefore, the interaction space is a subset of [gestures]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/gesture) described in HCI research previously. It does not contain gestures performed in mid-air or beat gestures marking the rhythm of speech, because they cannot be recognized or interpreted technically. Instead, Elastic displays are suitable for deictic gestures (pointing), iconic gestures (follow conventions to illustrate speech such as thumbs up) and symbolic/emblematic gestures (independent of speech such as sign-language) as these gestures can be performed by physically touching and shaping a malleable surface. Furthermore, **elastic displays enlarge the gestural interaction space** when compared to traditional HCI. Users can act out gestures in depth and benefit from the display's rich haptic feedback. Boundaries defining start and end of a single gesture are created implicitly by the user's intention to "tell" the display something meaningful and the capability of the tracking technologies.

## Set of Gestures

Our gesture set for elastic displays is based on 29 single- and both-handed gestures defined by Troiano et al. in [User-Defined Gestures for Elastic, Deformable Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references)) and a 10 gesture collection by Dand and Helmsley in [Obake: interactions with a 2.5D elastic display]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#links). (See [gestures]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/gesture) to learn more.) We combined the two collections by adopting only those gestures which, in our experience, have proven to be useful. This resulted in a set of 7 basic hand postures which can be classified into "single finger", "multiple finger"and "hand" postures, reflecting the area touched on the display. According to Kammer et al.'s classification in [Investigating Gestures on Elastic Tabletops]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references), elastic gestures also differ in the type of deformation they cause on the display ("push", "touch" or "pull"). Furthermore, they can be static, dynamic or circular using one or both hands. In real application scenarios, several users often interact with the application simultaneously.
