title: Rapid Prototyping
description: definition of rapid prototyping
---
Rapid prototyping is an umbrella term for a group of techniques that allow to quickly fabricate prototypes or scale models based on three-dimensional CAD data. It is used to identify weaks in an early product development state and to rapidly create demonstration material, minimizing production costs. Because objects are built by adding material layer by layer the process is also known as additive manufactoring. Common rapid prototyping techniques are for example 3D printing of CAD data, Space Puzzle Molding, Laminated Object Modelling or Contour Crafting.
