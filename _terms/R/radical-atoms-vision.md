The Radical Atoms Vision aims to make the physical state of [Tangible User Interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/tangible-user-interface) fully consistent with the underlying digital models and change the form or properties of physical objects in real time interactions. Hiroshi Ishii and the [Tangible Media Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#links) presented the vision in 2012 to overcome the limitations of their [Tangible Bits Vision]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/tangible-bits-vision) that are caused by the rigid atoms the TUIs consist of in comparison to the fluid digital bits they embody. Using computationally transformable and reconfigurable material they think of the user interface as material itself and propose to call it Material User Interface (MUI).
