Lyocell is a sustainable fabric used for clothing or other purposes. The fibre was further developed and is sometimes still referred to as Tencel. It consists of cellulose fibre, made from dissolving pulp and then reconstituting it by dry jet-wet spinning. Lyocell is more expensive to produce than cotton or viscose rayon but still affordable. 

**Advantages**

- durable
- can simulate various textures (like suede, leather, silk)
