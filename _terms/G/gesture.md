description: definition of gesture in SCI Knowledge Base

*"A gesture is a motion of the body that contains information. Waving goodbye is a gesture. Pressing a key on a keyboard is not a gesture because the motion of a finger on its way to hitting a key is neither observed nor significant. All that matters is which key was pressed".* [Kurtenbach and Hulteen]

Gestures are the input through which users interact with the interface of an display. But where exactly does it start and where does it end? Is it just a movement or maybe more? According to the cite from Kurtenbach and Hulteen a gesture can be defined as **movement of the body that is performed to convey meaning**. Meaning therefore implicitly determines the relevant components of a single gesture and sets its boundaries.

### Gesture Classifications

*Note*: The following compilation is not a complete collection of approaches to classify gestures that in our opinion are useful.

**General classification of gestures by Cadoz**,  
cited in [Ergotic / epistemic / semiotic functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) [Luciani]
1. Ergotic: modify environment using force
2. Epistemic : explore the environment via tactile sense
3. Semiotic : transfer information to the environment by following conventions, e.g. wave good-bye, sign language 

**General classification of gestures for gestural interfaces**,    
[An Intuitive Two-Handed Gestural Interface for Computer Supported Product Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) [Hummels et al.]

1. predefined symbolic commands (emblems): based on technical commands
2. gesticulations representing content of speech
3. act gestures to describe the form of objects (descriptive) or transform objects (manipulative)

**"Kendon's continuum", classification of gestures by dependency on speech (\*)**,  
cited in [Gesture: A Psycholinguistic Approach]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) [McNeil]

1. Gesticulations (Beat, Cohesive)
2. Language-Like (Iconic)
3. Pantomimes (Pantomimic)
4. Emblems (Deictic)
5. Sign Language (Symbolic)
(\*descending)

**Classification of semiotic gestures by Rime and Schiaratura**,  
cited in [Gestures in Human-Computer Interaction]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) [Muser]

1. Deictic: pointing, e.g. using a mouse pointer
2. Motoric: marks the rhythm of speech 
3. Symbolic / emblematic: contextual conventions, e.g. thumbs up
4. Iconic: represents the content of the speech, e.g. shape of an object
5. Metaphoric: illustrates abstract ideas

**General classification of elastic gestures**,    
[Investigating Gestures on Elastic Tabletops]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) [Kammer et al.]

PUSH - TOUCH - PULL 

**Classification of touch gestures for screen devices**,   
[Material Design: Types of Gestures]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#links) [Google]

1. navigational gestures (move through)
2. act gestures (complete actions + use shortcuts)
3. transform gestures (transform objects)
