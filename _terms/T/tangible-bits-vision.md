description: definition of Tangible Bits Vision
---

The Tangible Bits Vision was developed by Hiroshi Ishii and [Tangible Media Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#links) in 1997 who seeked to take advantage of the human skills to sense and manipulate the physical environment in order to explore digital information spaces. They proposed the concept of [Tangible User Interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/tangile-user-interface) (TUIs) to go beyong the "painted" bits on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Data (=bits) is given a tangible, physical form (=atoms), including for example directly graspable objects and augmented surfaces as well as ambient light, sound, airflow, and water movement.
