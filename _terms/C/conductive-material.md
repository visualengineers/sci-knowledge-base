title: Conductive Material
description: definition of Conductive Material
---
Every material is conducting, it’s only a matter of how what potential difference has to be applied. Relativly high conductive materials like metals are often used as in touch screen surfaces because they can convert a finger’s movement into a computational function. In order to do so they have to be highly transparent and conductive while having minimal haze and reflection. The most commonly used conductive material due to its relatively high manufacturability, cost, performance is Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). However, as ITO and many other electrode materials are not compatible with bendable or [flexible displays](/terms/flexible-display), alternatives are printed silver nanowires or NanoWeb®, a transparent, flexible, and durable metal electrode mesh film. It can be fabricated with almost any metal material and can be used in very large, curved and flexible touch screen devices also. Other research prototypes use for example conductive gel sandwiched between two silicon layers.
