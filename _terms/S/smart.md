description: definition of S.M.A.R.T. 
---
The letters of S.M.A.R.T. acronym give criteria which help setting objectives by pushing concrete statements, for example in project management. To take benefit from the S.M.A.R.T. criteria it is important to combine it with an action plan afterwards.  

*Note*: In certain situations this is not realistic or even dilutes the definition of the objective if you quantify all the criteria. Also, choosing certain combinations of these labels can cause duplication, you may take it as an offer from which you can choose. 

**S**. Specific (or strategic) – Be clear and specific with what you want to achieve.  
**M**. Measurable (or motivating) – Quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.   
**A**. Achievable (or attainable / assignable) – Specify who will do it.  
**R**. Relevant (or realistic) – State what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.  
**T**. Time-bound (ot trackable) – Specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

*"We will have constructed a functional prototype of an elastic display that reacts upon gestural input in a visible ways within four months after three months of intense study of tracking technologies, software frameworks and surface materials."*

**Specific**:  
The goal of constructing a functional prototype is well-defined.  
**Measurable**:  
Success can be measured by the decisions made in favour of a particular method of implementation, construction plans and improvements.  
**Achievable**:  
The goal setters will have the appropriate skills for the task due to their prior experience and intense study.  
**Relevant**:  
The goal setters are planning to build an innovative application in the field of industry they are currently working in.
