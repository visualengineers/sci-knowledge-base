description: definition of 3D Printing

3D printing is the manufactoring process of making three dimensional solid objects from a  three-dimensional digital model.  It is a commonly used prototyping technique to be able to go to market faster. 
Based on the instructions in the printing file a 3D printing machine lays down thin layers of a material in succession. Therefore it is also known as additive manufactoring. Printing techniques and materials vary, the cheapest and most common being Fusion Deposition Modeling (FDM) with colorful ABS plastic. However, 3D printers can also print nylon and resins, metals or ceramic in a more detailed and durable way using techniques like for example Stereolithography (SLA), Jetting Processes or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).
